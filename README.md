## Introduction

This is a simple Python script I wrote for parsing transcript files we have. The transcripts were in a Word document and needed to be brought into our WordPress site. My script parses the transcript and adds paragraph markers and wraps it in our transcript container code.

## Code Example

The original transcript should be pasted into **transcript.txt**. When the program is run, it will output the new formatted version to **transcript-formatted.txt**

## Installation

This program is written in Python so and does not use any external libraries.
